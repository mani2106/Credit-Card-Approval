# Credit-Card-Approval
Notebook Code and Presentation for Kaggle credit card default challenge

**The Notebook was run in colab so the portions of paths like `/content` need to be changed to run locally**.

The [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SlbGt52epEHkpJhME9Zfrv8adOnDeilazRtRV55YjiY/edit?usp=sharing) should contain a few explaining the assumptions and decisions made during the analysis.

The [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1u4Q7uP6u_T6SseD8cNdcGXJorU_K115Z?usp=sharing) can also be viewed in Google colab.

I recommend to view the notebook in colab so that the sections and subsections maybe accessed easily
