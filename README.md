# Credit-Card-Approval
Notebook Code and Presentation for Kaggle credit card default challenge

**The Notebook was run in colab so the portions of paths like `/content` need to be changed to run locally**.

The presentation should contain a few explaining the assumptions and decisions made during the analysis.
